# LEDgame


Created a simple game using Arduino UNO, LEDs, Push Button Switch, Resistors, Wires and BreadBoard.


The motive of the game is to push the push button switch as soon as the RED LED lights up. If the player is successful in pushing the button at that particular instant all the three LEDs light up conveying the player has won
